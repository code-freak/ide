Code FREAK IDE Docker Image
==
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/code-freak/ide.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/code-freak/ide)

This is the default IDE image used by [`code-freak`](https://github.com/code-freak/code-freak). It spins up
an editor on the server that is accessible via browser.  
Currently we use [`code-server`](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) as IDE.
